		<p><em>Chatplode</em> was a business venture that the client wanted to create to allow a user to upload an image and chat about it for up to 24 hours. The concept was very simple, and I had to do a little design work since a Theme Forest theme was provided. The difficult part was creating a production site built with <a href='/category/nodejs'>nodejs<a/> and <a href='category/mongodb'>mongodb</a></p>
		<p>This was my first site that went into production that was built on <a href='/category/nodejs'>nodejs<a/> + <a href='category/mongodb'>mongodb<a/>. On top of having to figure out how to push a <a href='/category/nodejs'>nodejs</a> live on a rackspace server (which I also setup for the client), I ended up writing my own chat application code from scratch. Yes I know there are a lot of frameworks available for this but it is something I always wanted to write, for some reason. Unfortunately the client has since taken the site down.</p>
