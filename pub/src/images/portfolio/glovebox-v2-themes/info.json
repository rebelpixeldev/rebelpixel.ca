		<p>This is the second version of the themes that are used for dealers on the <a href='/category/glovebox'>Glovebox</a> system. In this second version of the themes the <a href='/category/css'>css</a> framework and how everything is structured was changed. With encorporating Foundation it gave us the <a href='category/responsive'>responsivness</a> we wanted and with the custom <a href='category/css'>sass</a> hiearchy I built, it gave us the ease of extending themes.</p>
		<p>These were the first <a href='/category/responsive'>responsive</a> dealer sites on any system in Canada and it was no easy task. The hardest part to this build was definetly the navigation. I wanted to use the built in Foundation navigation but the <a href='/category/html'>html</a> structure was very limiting when creating the drop downs on the full sized site. With a lot of perseverance, patients and a little magic I found a solid solution and now it functions as was intended.</p>
