		<p>This site was for the launch of the new brand <em>You Move Me</em>, located in both the US and Canada. This site had a lot of firsts for me which included, the first non automotive site built on <a href='/category/glovebox'>Glovebox</a>; the first site on <a href='/category/glovebox'>Glovebox</a> that needed a blog engine; the first time I used had used foundation <a href='/category/css'>css</a> framework; and the first time I had coded (a somewhat) <a href='/category/responsive'>responsive</a> layout. With their business model, the need for franchises to have their own site within the corporate site was needed to be built into <a href='/category/glovebox'>Glovebox</a>.</p>
		<p>Since there were many new things with this site, there were many challenges with this site. I had to build  a blog engine into <a href='/category/glovebox'>Glovebox</a>, which mainly included creating a taxonomy schema and all the hooks for that into <a href='/category/glovebox'>Glovebox</a>. When it comes to the layout, the sidebar was the most difficult part of the front end. In the end I had to use some <a href='/category/javascript'>javascript</a> to manipulate the layout on document load (something that I cringe at the thought of but sometimes thereâ€™s no other way).</p>
