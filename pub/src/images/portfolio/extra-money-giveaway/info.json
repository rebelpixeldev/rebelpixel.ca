		<p><em>The Extra Money Giveaway</em> was a mircosite developed for <em>H&R Block</em> as a fun way to give away money and free tax services. This site hasn't been up for a while now but it was one of my first full site builds I had ever done. The site was built using <a href='/category/actionscript+3'>flash<a/> and <a href='/category/actionscipt+3'>papaervision 3d</a> in order to achieve the 3d floating. The most intertesting part that was done on this site was the reflection on the cubes. Papervision has a reflection class for the cubes but it didâ€™t achieve the look that we were going for so I had to write my own. In the end I duplicated the image that was on the face of the cube on the fly, flipped it and created a gradient mask on the bottom from the bottom up.</p>
