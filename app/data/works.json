	"description": "<p>Ever since I started at Dashboard we were asked to put third party chat systems onto our clients websites. In my opinon the majority of them looked and functioned like garbage and I always wanted to build a better version. After going to NADA (the biggest dealer confrence in North america), I set off to start building some call tracking software built on the Octane framework. This didn't last long and I pivoted to building a full blown chat app with a little twist. Instead of being stuck to having to be on the computer to see and respond to visitors on your site, You were able to forward the message to your phone via SMS and MMS messages. I used the Twilio api to forward messages to the dealer or the user if they simply put in their cell number.</p><p>I used NodeJS and Socket.io to provide the realtime chat and the Twilio NodeJS module to interact with Twilio. There were a few hardships along the way and one of the biggest ones was to build the criteria on when or if to forward the message. There was a couple of iteractions on this but I ended up coming up with something elegant that solved for forwarding and made everything easier to read.</p><p>I teamed up with a collegue to help with the interface and design of the admin area and the chat that appears on a dealers site. Everything ended up looking super crisp and it was very easy to use. We built it into the Octane platform to provide a seamless integration to the other product on the Octane platform. While this never went to production it was a great side project build from scratch by myself and build the presentation and design with a collegue.</p>",

	"description": "<p>Odometer is the big data component of the Octane platform. It is a simple script that you embed on a site and it will collect clickstream data for each user that visits their site.</p><p>Before starting on this I had only done a little work with MongoDB with very few entries. Odometer has millions of entries and I needed to run large queries with analysis. I ended up using the built in Mongo functions MapReduce and Aggegation to run the quieres and analysis in one task and save the aggregated data separtly so I can query it for the front end later on. I learned a lot how the internals on Mongo and its indexes work which sped up the queries in a very noticiable way.</p>",

	"description": "<p>This was one of the funnest and interesting projects with the most gotchas and challenges that I have ever worked on. The dealer would have access to an admin area to build and  completely customize a page takeover on their site. After embedding a javascript snippet on their site, they have full control the pages the takeover shows up on, how ofter and when it shows up</p><p>Since there are over 30 different modules I wanted to build a framework to build the modules as quick as possible and for each one to follow the same convention so everything is consistent. The idea was that all of the boilerplate would be done in the framework and you would just need to build the specific functionality and styles for each specific module. I accomplished this by building an event and object based solution that was easy to build new modules and track the events within the module.</p>",

	"description": "<p>The grand vision of Octane was to become an app store for auto dealerships. The meant that the code needed to be flexible and allow to easily add and remove features both in core services and the site itself.</p><p>Building Octane and the Octane framework was the biggest learning experience I have encountered in my career to date. Learning new design patterns, how to scale both with users and products, and learning Angular were among the largest challenges. Angular plays a huge role in the interface. We needed a way to share components across multiple products (Spark, Glovebox V3, Revups) but also have those products be used in isolation. What we came up with was a build process that would build files based on smaller files that had only one piece of logic in them. This gave us tha ability to override specific directives, functions, or views throughout the suite of products.</p>",

	"description": "<p>I was really excited when I landed this project. The best way for me to learn something is by actually doing it but most of the time i get bored and go onto something else before finishing it off. Fortunatly working for a client, not finishing is not an option, so I had to learn how to build a native android app fast.</p><p>The app was part of an installation promoting walmarts black web speakers. A person would get into a booth and click an icon corresponding to where a sound played out of the speaker played. There were two rounds, one with speakers in the 4 corners of the booth playing tunes and the second playing through bluetoother headphones out of each ear.</p><p>The real issue with the project where there was 4 speakers (one in each corner of the room). Initially I had 4 single channel bluetooth speakers and would randomize the connection to each speaker. The problem was that once a speaker connects through bluetooth, a connect sound would play from the speaker. After wasting days on tring to figure out how to turn this sound off I needed another idea. I ended up using two 2 channel speakers, connecting one through the headphone jack and the other through bluetooth. Since each speaker had a left and right channel I was able to mimic the sound coming out of all four corners of the room, success! (or so I thought)</p><p>While everything worked well the first and sometimes the second time through, there was a bug that was difficult to recreate that had to do with the bluetooth speaker not connecting properly. After 50 hours of search google and stackoverflow I finally figured out the issue has to do with the newer version of the Android MediaPlayer library. Once switching back to V4 everything worked fine and it was a feeling that I will never forget.
