All the code for my portfolio site.

Some features that I want to implement

* Some sort of avatar to to connect all people who are on the site using socket.io
* Theme changes based on the time of day in Toronto (possibly what the weather is like as well)
* Single page app. (Maybe trying out React but might not be big enough)
